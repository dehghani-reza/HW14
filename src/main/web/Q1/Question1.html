                <p>Amy normally hated Monday mornings, but this year was different. Kamal was in her art class and she
                    liked Kamal. She was waiting outside the classroom when her friend Tara arrived.
                    “Hi Amy! Your mum sent me a text. You forgot your inhaler. Why don’t you turn your phone on?” Amy
                    didn’t like technology. She never sent text messages and she hated Facebook too.</p>
